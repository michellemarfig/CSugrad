/* 
 *  1)  Take 5 different distance measurements noting the exact distance.  Report these values. 
 *  
 *          156 at 1 inch
 *          208 at 2 inch
 *          308 at 3 inch
 *          552 at 4 inch
 *          804 atn6 inch
 *          

2)  Calculate how many microseconds one foot is.  Show your work

           1716 - micros() = answer

3)  What is the minimum and maximum effective measuring distance of the device?  Provide a link along with your answer

            1‚Äù to 13 feet.
            https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_quick_guide.htm
            
4)  Is it possible for our ISR to be interrupted with another PINB, pin 1 state change? 

        No the code has to run until it is finished before another interupt can be processed.
